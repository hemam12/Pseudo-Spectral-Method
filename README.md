# Pseudo-Spectral-Method
Nonlinear Coupling of Kinetic Alfven Waves and ion acoustic waves in the inner heliosphere


This is a Fortran program used to solve PDEs by pseudospectral method.
Forward difference in time with predictor corrector method is used to calculate
the next time steps. FFT in space coordinates is used.
Dealiasing is applied using phase shift methods.
It is (2+1) dimensional program.
Relevant equations are found in the paper
